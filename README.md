An Exact Method for Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Received Signal Strength based Source Localization
The repository contains MATLAB code for the algorithm RSS-ML.

Abstract of the paper:
In this paper, we develop an exact algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimate for source localization using received signal strength measurements. Unlike the conventional
methods that resort to first-order Taylor's approximation to linearize
the RSS data model and solve for the parameters of the associated linear model, we work with the actual non-linear data model
and propose a novel algorithm for solving the associated ML estimation problem.
More specifically, we reformulate the original minimization problem into a min-max problem and solve the resultant problem via the majorization-minimization. The resultant algorithm is iterative in nature, and each iteration involves solving a simple convex problem. Through various numerical simulation results, we illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method when compared against the state of the art methods.
